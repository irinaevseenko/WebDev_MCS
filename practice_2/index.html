					<h2 class="sectionText" id="biography">Biography</h2>
					<p class="mainText">Tomás Saraceno is an Argentinian contemporary artist. He is best known for his large-scale, interactive installations and floating sculptures, and for his interdisciplinary approach to art. After studying art and architecture in Buenos Aires, Frankfurt am Main, and Venice, Tomás Saraceno established his studio in Frankfurt am Main in 2005. His practice moves toward the entanglement of diverse threads of thought, including art, life science and the social sciences. Enmeshed at the junction of these worlds, his floating sculptures, community projects and interactive installations propose and explore new, sustainable ways of inhabiting and sensing the environment.</p>

					<p class="mainText">14 Billions (Working Title) is one of several works arising from the artist’s deep interest in the spider web and it seeks to explore the correspondences between the spider web and the cosmic web: disturbing and transgressing notions of scale, and speculating upon parallels in the organisation of organic and inorganic structures. For the large-scale spatial installation, Saraceno developed a new method for creating a three-dimensional scan of the web of a black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans). This method, combines Laser Supported Tomography with Photogrammetric analysis to produce a digital reconstruction of a complex three-dimensional spider web – a task previously impossible due to limitations of existing techniques. From this scan and 3D data, the artist reconstructed a 16.7:1 scale Black Widow web using 8000 lengths of nylon rope connected by over 23,000 individually tied knots, and spanning 400 cubic metres. This work was exhibited at Bonniers Konsthall, Stockholm and at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in 2010.</p>

					<h2 class="sectionText" id="project2">Poetic Cosmos of the Breath</h2>
					<p class="mainText">For the International Artist Airshow in Gunpowder Park London, in 2007 Saraceno was invited to present a new installation, commissioned by the Arts Catalysts. Poetic Cosmos of the Breath is a solar dome of around 60 m diameter, made of thin iridescent foil, anchored with sandbags to the ground. On September 22nd 2007 at dawn, the giant dome slowly inflated with the air and gradually grew with the sun. Aided by the participants,  Poetic Cosmos of the Breath is a performative event and an invitation to collectively attune to the natural rhythms that encircle us, the clouds, the sun, the blue skies and rainbows.</p>
					<p class="mainText">As the sun rises, the air inside the sculpture starts to heat up, causing the sculpture to start to lift and activating the iridescent foil into a cascade of reflections and refractions. The irradiating surface of the foil becomes illuminative compliment to the natural environment of the park, redirecting and expanding the reflections of the sky and its ever changing, boundary-blurring weather patterns. In his artistic practice, Saraceno  expands on the aesthetic experience as a synesthetic moment, encouraging the viewers to ponder the gamut and boundaries of our sensorial perception. The iridescent surface traces the sun’s rays, kaleidoscopically casting colours, shadows and reflections around. Air and light lend the sculpture its form,  inviting a shift in our perceptual norms, engendering the imaginative capacities of humans to consider different modes of being and dreaming of different futures, that embodies a symbiotic relationship with the Earth, the sun and the elements.</p>
